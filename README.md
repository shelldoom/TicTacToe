# Tic Tac Toe AI with minimax

Playable Tic Tac Toe game with AI

Supports `m x n` tictactoe âˆ€ m > 0 and n > 0.

Increasing the minimax depth will result in a better AI (up till a certain depth) but slower response. The response also becomes slow for larger matrices.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shelldoom/TicTacToe
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./main.py
```
